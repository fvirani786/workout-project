A full breakdown! 

under Workout Tracker

  -I created an id called workoutForm and inside of that a few input types. I've also added a placeholder 

  -Next I made it requried to select a workout type for that day. Once you hit submit  it will show a list of the workouts. If (requried) is gone and the user clicks "Add Workout", a blank form will be shown. This will be added later on





Features to add on: 

-If user doesn't fill in the requried blanks, they will get an alert saying to fill out 
or the box turns red 

-Let's user create their own workout for that day

-Let's user select more than one 








Things to improve:
